A user will enter the username they want details for.
The user is then shown a table with all the details of the user's repos listed inside.
Made using React (JavaScript).


### issues:
- ~~doesn't show repos as soon as opened. hook changes needed.~~
- ~~when name/description too big, the action button in column not properly centered.~~
- ~~pagination needs to be added. only 4 repos shown at a time (maybe 5).~~
- lastly deploy on sth.
- maybe convert to typescript
